## 🚨 I Didn’t Lose Because of Code

I realized something hard to admit—  
**I didn’t fail because of code.**  
**I failed because of how I *showed up*.**

### 🧠 My Mind Was Ready.  
But...

- 🗣️ My words weren’t clear  
- 😬 My confidence was shaky  
- 🙅‍♂️ My body said I wasn’t ready

## 🎯 What I Learned

### 🛑 Interviews aren’t just about answers  
They’re about the **first few minutes**  
That’s when **first impressions** are made  
That’s when **decisions** begin

---

The hiring manager sees:

- ✨ Your energy  
- 👀 Your eye contact  
- 💺 Your posture  
- 🔊 Your voice

And then?

Their brain activates **confirmation bias**:

- If you seem **unsure** → They notice your stumbles  
- If you seem **confident** → They look for reasons to trust you

## 📈 So I Got to Work

- 🎙️ Studied communication  
- 🧘 Practiced posture & presence  
- 💡 Learned to *own* the room  

---

## 🚀 The Result?

- I don’t just **code** better  
- I **communicate** better  
- I **connect** better  

And now, when I interview—  
**I walk in like I belong there**

> ✨ **Struggling with interviews?**  
> Maybe it’s not your skills.  
> Maybe it’s how they see you.

You don’t need to be perfect.  
You just need to 🎤 **Own the room**
